            <h1>Sachin Tendulker</h1>
            <h2><span>An Indian Former International Cricketer</span></h2>
            <p>Sachin Tendulkar has been the most complete batsman of his time, the most prolific runmaker of all time,<br> and arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known. His batting was based
                on the purest principles: <br> perfect balance, economy of movement, precision in stroke-making, and that  intangible quality given only <br> to geniuses - anticipation. If he didn't have a signature stroke.
                the upright, back-foot punch comes close - it's <br> because he was equally proficient at each of the full  range of orthodox shots (and plenty of improvised <br> ones as well) and can pull them out at will
                There were no apparent weaknesses in Tendulkar's game. He could <br> score all around the wicket, off both  front foot and back, could tune his technique to suit every condition, temper <br> his game to
                suit every situation, and made runs in all parts of the world in all conditions.</p>
